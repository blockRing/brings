# blockRing™ : making usable blockchains ...


A blockchain is 3 things :

1. a chain for documents (blocks) secured with a hash function (in our case we picked [shake-224][sk224])
   an easy way to achieve this is simply storing the documents in a "[content-addressable-storage][CAS]"
   and referring the previous document in each documents and store
   
2. a pointer to the top of the chain ([mutable]) and a mechanism to update it (consensus)

   any permissionless system requires 
 
3. A DDoS / Sybil attack mitigation technique (validation)

<!-- consensus: stop the aberation : bitcoin is the most locked-up software ever can't change a bit !
  code as "immutable" law ! === that's jail for life !

  and is against any form of life and its natural evolution ...
-->



### Current implementation of blockchain have lots of limitations slowing down its adoption.

### Our blockRing™ technology objective is to address the following problems

* energy efficiency (no wasteful mining)
* no central influence or single point of failure (true distribution of power)
* resilient to censorship
* private
* incorruptible


Our blockRings are permissionned and are fragmented locally to improve security

we store data in immutable object, and collect sets of immutable into mutable
we update and sign within a WoT.

For truly anonymous transactions, we use [pull request][PR] technique with a rate filter 

All physical individual have a "tamper proof self sovereign identity" to be authenticated
for every values exchanges.

Process for cashout is at the "physical world speed" an can be therefore "manually" verified
